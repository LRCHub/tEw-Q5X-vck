Timecop1983 & Waves On Waves “The Quiet Life”_100bpm_Emin
You and I could lead the quiet life;
cnd you and I were meant for more in life; You and I are not the quiet type;
cnd you and I could lead the quiet life;
I want to do it again;
Be lovers and friends before the summer ends; You've got the upper hand;
You've got me pounding sand;
cnd chasing the wind;
I want to do it again;
Be lovers and friends before the summer ends; You've got the upper hand;
You've got me pounding sand;
cnd chasing the wind;
Cause:
You and I could lead the quiet life;
cnd you and I were meant for more in life; You and I are not the quiet type;
cnd you and I could lead the quiet life; Um hm baby;
Um hm baby;
Um hm baby;
Could lead the quiet life;
You spin around in my head; Repeating things that you said; cnd now I'm seeing red; You've got the upper hand; You've got me pounding sand; cnd chasing the wind;
I want to do it again;
Be lovers and friends before the summer ends; You've got the upper hand;
You've got me pounding sand;
cnd chasing the wind;
Cause:
You and I could lead the quiet life;
cnd you and I were meant for more in life; You and I are not the quiet type;
cnd you and I could lead the quiet life; Um hm baby;
Um hm baby;
Um hm baby;
Could lead the quiet life.
